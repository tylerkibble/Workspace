Make a AI assistant for dungeon master

- Auto generate events that happen during gameplay and creating a "wiki" style story database¬†
- Use obsidian and langchain [Obsidian | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/document_loaders/obsidian/)
- Provide potential options for players during the campaign - for now can create a website that has a dungeon master login portal and player portal (invite code from dungeon master) when the player is invited they are brought to the character creation menu of that specific game showing all the characters playing the game (all characters created will be password protected but selectable incase others want to share their characters with each other), once a character is created by the player a password is then added to that character so when they come back to the game they can continue with that character.
- Create characters using voice to text descriptions of what you want to play
- dungeon master likely needs to have pc with ai voice transcriptions running
Dungeon master portal:

- Event creator that will provide more ideas based off of game play as well as new and unique ideas. It will also allow for typing the general idea of a story, actions possible, quests, monsters, difficulty, theme and then create a fully fleshed out modular story one step at a time with options for the dungeon master to provide feedback for changes if the AI module didn't get it correct. For each event created in the story the module should provide at least at minimum 3 successful ways the adventurers in the story can succeed with no maximum ways of failure or success; endless creativity is the goal. The more options the dungeon master is provided for potential ways an event can be ‚Äòsimulated‚Äô the better. Once the multiple event options are created for the dungeon master there should be a way to edit and provide feedback to be more accurate to the dungeon master's vision of the event. The events created should then also have sub category event ideas generated. It should be easy for the dungeon master to save ‚Äúevent types‚Äù creating a stored/saved template for ease of creating twists off of past events. Events will then be saved and added to the story. To link events together in the story the VaultMaster Assistant will provide ideas and have an area for the dungeon master to provide insight for the direction of the story
    

- The Event creator will then create a "wiki" style story database to capture what is generally happening in a story for the player to follow along.
    
- Voice to text option for the dungeon master to create the story
    

- Item Creator: Allows the dungeon master to create classes of items, the module will create a predefined item list based on ‚Äúevent types‚Äù¬† which will have an option for the dungeon master to add more unique items and ideas for loot generated/ rarity of loot generated
    

- Item creator will have predefined fields for the dungeon master to fill out or have an option to write a paragraph about the idea of what an item should be. When an item is created there should be multiple versions (ie basic, magical effect, cursed, enhanced,¬† that are available but more rare depending on how good the properties. Once an item is created the item will then be split into their respective tier of items, for example the dungeon master creates a sword, this item is then divided into multiple rarities ie basic, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary and mythic; these tiers are the base power and how many respective effects an item can be imbued with (imbueing will come later on). the sword then can be assigned to a respective monster or NPC as a drop or reward. If an item is left unassigned to something the AI module should create a ‚Äúcreature/NPC‚Äù (creature/NPC creator) that fits thematically with the ‚Äúevent type‚Äù and item dropped
    

Gameplay:

- Have a table top ai transcriptor microphone to add to the correct ‚Äúwiki‚Äù page for actions, events, and items obtained
    

- Items obtained by each character at the end of an encounter is then saved and synced to their character profile which should eventually have a UI for mobile players to adjust their characters equipment, level up, use different items (ie Luck modifier item that increases the parties drop rates)
