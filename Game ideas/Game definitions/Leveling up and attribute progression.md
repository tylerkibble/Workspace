As characters gain experience and level up, they'll receive attribute bonuses that can be distributed among their attributes. This system emphasizes strategic decision-making about where to invest these points, as choosing to boost one attribute might come at the expense of another.

- **Attribute Bonuses:** Upon leveling up, characters receive a pool of points to allocate among their attributes. The number of points awarded increases with the level, allowing for significant customization opportunities.

- **Attribute Maximums:** To prevent characters from becoming overly powerful in one aspect at the cost of others, there will be limits to how much an attribute can be increased through leveling. Reaching these limits will require finding other ways to enhance attribute effectiveness, such as through equipment or special abilities.

- **Skill Proficiency Gains:** Alongside attribute bonuses, characters will gain new skill proficiencies as they level up. These skills can be selected from a broader pool, allowing for further specialization in areas relevant to the character's class and background.

- **Ability Score Increases:** At certain levels, characters receive additional points to increase their attribute scores beyond the initial distribution. This allows for further customization and specialization as characters advance.

- **XP Earning Potential:** Different classes may excel in various activities, leading to differences in how much XP they can accumulate. For example, a rogue might earn more XP from stealth missions and thievery, while a warrior might gain more from direct combat encounters.

- **Rate of Leveling:** The rate at which a character levels up depends on the class. Some classes might have a slower leveling curve due to the nature of their skills and abilities, requiring more careful strategy and planning to advance. Whil
