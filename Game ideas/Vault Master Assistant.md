### Project Overview

Develop an AI assistant for dungeon masters that leverages Obsidian and [LangChain](LangChain.md). The assistant will provide functionalities such as [[auto-generating events]], creating a "[[wiki]]" style [[story database]], and offering potential options for players during [[campaigns]]. Additionally, it will feature a website with distinct portals for [[Dungeon masters portal]] and the [[Player portal]], which facilitate [[character creation]] and [[management]], and incorporate [[voice-to-text]] capabilities.

### Key Features

1. **Auto-Generate Events**
    
    - **Objective**: Automatically generate [[in-game events]] to keep the campaign dynamic and engaging.
    - **Implementation**: Use [[LangChain]] to process game state and context, and generate appropriate events based on predefined rules or AI models.
    - **Data Input**: Events can be influenced by the current storyline, character actions, and random elements to ensure unpredictability.
2. **[story database](story%20database.md) ("[wiki](wiki.md)" Style)**
    
    - **Objective**: Maintain a comprehensive and easily accessible database of the game’s lore, characters, locations, items, and events.
    - **Implementation**: Use Obsidian to create and manage this database, utilizing its linking and note-taking capabilities to create an interconnected web of information.
    - **Data Management**: Dungeon masters can manually add entries or have them auto-generated by the AI as the game progresses.
3. **Player Options During Campaigns**
    
    - **Objective**: Provide dungeon masters with a range of potential player actions and responses to ensure a rich interactive experience.
    - **Implementation**: Generate suggestions based on the current game context using LangChain. These options can be dynamically updated as the game unfolds.
4. **Website with Dungeon Master and Player Portals**
    
    - **Objective**: Create a centralized platform for game management and player interaction.
    - **Dungeon Master Portal**:
        - Features: Campaign management, event generation controls, story database access, player management.
        - Security: Secure login with advanced authentication.
    - **Player Portal**:
        - Features: Character creation, game session access, viewing other characters (with permissions), and participating in campaigns.
        - Invite System: Players join the game via invite codes from the dungeon master.
        - Character Management: Password-protected characters that can be shared or kept private.
5. **Character Creation**
    
    - **Objective**: Simplify character creation using voice-to-text technology.
    - **Implementation**: Integrate a voice recognition system that allows players to describe their characters verbally. The AI then converts these descriptions into structured character profiles.
    - **Data Input**: Players describe attributes, backstory, appearance, and abilities.
6. **Voice Transcription for Dungeon Masters**
    
    - **Objective**: Enable dungeon masters to control and interact with the AI assistant using voice commands.
    - **Implementation**: Set up AI voice transcription software on the dungeon master’s PC. This system should integrate seamlessly with the assistant to interpret commands and update the game state accordingly.

### Technical Requirements

1. **Obsidian Integration**
    
    - Use Obsidian’s plugin API to create custom plugins that manage the story database and integrate with the LangChain model for event generation.
2. **LangChain Integration**
    
    - Develop a LangChain model that understands and processes game context to generate events and player options.
    - Ensure the model can interact with the Obsidian database for real-time updates and information retrieval.
3. **Website Development**
    
    - Use modern web development frameworks (e.g., React for frontend, Node.js for backend) to build the dungeon master and player portals.
    - Implement secure authentication and user management systems.
4. **Voice-to-Text and AI Voice Transcription**
    
    - Integrate a robust voice recognition API (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text) for accurate character creation and command interpretation.
    - Ensure the transcription system is optimized for the specific vocabulary and context of tabletop role-playing games.
