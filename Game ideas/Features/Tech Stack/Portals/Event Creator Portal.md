### Event Creator Breakdown
**https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/events/**
#### Core Objective

The event creator will generate dynamic, modular story events based on gameplay context. It will allow the dungeon master to input initial ideas and refine them through feedback, ensuring the final output aligns with the dungeon master’s vision. It will also capture the evolving narrative in a "wiki" style database and support voice-to-text input for hands-free story creation.
