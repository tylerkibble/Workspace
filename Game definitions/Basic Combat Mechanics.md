### Basic Mechanics

Combat in our RPG will occur in real-time, with turns alternating between players and enemies. Actions will be divided into rounds, with each round representing a brief moment in time during the encounter.

- **Turn Order:** Turn order is determined by initiative, which is calculated based on a combination of a character's Dexterity modifier and any relevant buffs or debuffs. Characters act in descending order of their initiative scores.

- **Actions:** Each character has a limited number of action points per turn, which can be spent on various actions such as attacking, defending, casting spells, or using abilities. The number of action points and the availability of certain actions depend on the character's class and level.

### Combat Rounds

A combat round consists of several phases:

1. **Action Phase:** Characters take turns performing actions. Players control their characters, deciding how to allocate their action points among available actions.

2. **Free Action Phase:** After all characters have taken their actions, free actions can be performed. These include moving, readying actions for the next round, or using abilities that don't consume action points.

3. **End-of-Round Phase:** Any conditions or effects that expire at the end of a round are resolved. This phase also includes checking for death or incapacitation of characters.

### Attacking

Attacks are made using the appropriate attribute (Strength for melee, Dexterity for ranged) plus any relevant modifiers. Hits and misses are determined by rolling a twenty-sided die (d20) and comparing the result against a target number based on the attacker's and defender's attributes and circumstances.

- **Melee Attacks:** Characters wielding melee weapons add their Strength modifier to their attack roll. Hits deal damage based on the weapon and the attacker's Strength modifier.

- **Ranged Attacks:** Ranged weapons add the wielder's Dexterity modifier to their attack roll. Hits deal damage based on the weapon and the shooter's Dexterity modifier.

- **Spellcasting:** Casting spells involves a separate mechanic where spellcasters expend spell slots or cantrips to unleash magical effects. The effectiveness of spells is influenced by the caster's Intelligence or Charisma (depending on the school of magic) and the level of the spell.

### Defending

Defenders can choose to defend instead of taking an action, reducing incoming damage. The amount of damage reduced depends on the defender's Constitution modifier and any defensive abilities or equipment they possess.

### Special Abilities and Spells

Characters can use special abilities or spells as part of their action points. These abilities vary widely depending on the character's class and level, ranging from powerful combat maneuvers to magical effects. Using these abilities consumes action points and may have cooldown periods.

### Encounters

Encounters can range from simple skirmishes against individual enemies to complex battles against groups of foes. The difficulty of encounters scales with the challenge rating, which takes into account the number and types of enemies, environmental hazards, and other factors.

This combat system aims to balance strategic depth with accessibility, allowing players to engage in dynamic and satisfying combat encounters. By carefully managing action points and leveraging character abilities effectively, players can navigate the challenges presented by the game world.
