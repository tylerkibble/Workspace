### Attribute Definitions

In our RPG, characters are defined by six primary attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each attribute has a base value assigned to every character at creation, which can be adjusted through experience and leveling up.

- **Strength** affects physical power and melee combat effectiveness. Higher Strength allows characters to deal more damage with melee weapons and carry heavier loads.
    
- **Dexterity** influences agility and ranged combat accuracy. Characters with high Dexterity find it easier to hit targets with ranged weapons and perform actions that require quick reflexes, such as dodging or picking locks.
    
- **Constitution** determines a character's health and resilience. Characters with higher Constitution values are harder to kill and recover faster from injuries.
    
- **Intelligence** impacts a character's knowledge and magical aptitude. It affects the potency of spells cast and the speed at which characters learn new skills or spells.
    
- **Wisdom** reflects a character's insight and connection to the world around them. It influences the effectiveness of divine magic, perception checks, and the ability to interact meaningfully with the environment.
    
- **Charisma** affects a character's ability to lead, persuade, and charm others. It plays a crucial role in social interactions and can influence the loyalty and cooperation of companions or NPCs.
